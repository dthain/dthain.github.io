<h3>Research</h3>
<div class=innerbox>
I lead the  <a href=http://ccl.cse.nd.edu>Cooperative Computing Lab</a>,
where my team creates <a href=http://ccl.cse.nd.edu/software>software</a>
that allows people to easily harness hundreds
to thousands of computers from clusters, clouds, and grids.  Our software
is used around the world to solve large scale problems in many fields
of science and engineering.
I am always looking for excellent students to join the <a href=http://ccl.cse.nd.edu/research/people>CCL Team</a>.  To learn more, <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLVMZCBgSAPms7wJHRrFo3KQo85ProN093&v=vPJnsB6d0Ws>watch this movie</a>, <a href=http://dthain.blogspot.com>read my blog</a>, or <a href=http://ccl.cse.nd.edu>visit my research lab</a>.
